# next steps

- images through markdown
- themes (colorful/black&white)
- email
- current exhibition to frontpage based on date

# tutorial

I am going through a tutorial from Josh Collinsworth called [Build static SvelteKit Markdown blog](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/build-static-sveltekit-markdown-blog)

The tutorial is now done up until "Optional finishing touches and extra features". Perhaps in the future it would be nice to do some of the suggested things:
- exhibition categories
- heading links within posts
- page head meta tags for correct sharing images and exhibition titles in the browser tab
- improving api for pagination when there are a lot of past exhibitions
- 


# Genaral Svelte readme below

## create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm init svelte@next

# create a new project in my-app
npm init svelte@next my-app
```

> Note: the `@next` is temporary

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment.
