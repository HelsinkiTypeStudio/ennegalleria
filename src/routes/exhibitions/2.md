In March 2022, poet Haydée Touitou leaves Paris for Finland where she is about to start a month-long writing residency at Villa Sarkia, in the town of Sysmä.


She begins to write about her first impressions of this country she has never been before. Each day brings a new adventure from the swimming hall, the nearby forest on an island and the deserted ice cream stand.


Haydée then makes her way to Helsinki for a shorter residency at Villa Eläintarha ending on April 11th, 2022. The result of these notes on impressions is “Forty Three Days in Finland” presented here accompanied with images by Hikari Nishida at Enne Galleria.
